# Problem Statement

The website addresses several critical issues faced by wildlife enthusiasts and conservation efforts in India by offering a centralized, user-friendly platform for information and transactions related to wildlife sanctuarie.

<h2>Problem 1:Fragmented Information</h2>

Solution: The website consolidates information about various wildlife sanctuaries across India into a single, easily navigable platform. Users can access essential details such as location maps, visiting hours, entry fees, and regulations, which are often scattered across multiple sources or hard to find. By providing links to official websites, the site ensures that users have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information.

<h2>Problem 2: Lack of Personalized Assistance</h2>

Solution: Planning a trip to a wildlife sanctuary involves numerous details and can be overwhelming, especially for first-time visitors. The AI chatbot on the website provides personalized assistance, answering questions and offering tailored recommendations. This interactive feature enhances user experience by helping visitors plan their trips effectively and addressing their specific needs and queries.

<h2>Problem 3: Donation Transparency and Efficiency</h2>

Solution: Wildlife sanctuaries often rely on donations for maintenance and conservation efforts, but the process can lack transparency, deterring potential donors. The website uses smart contracts to ensure that all transactions are secure and transparent. Donors can see how their contributions are being used, fostering trust and encouraging more people to support conservation efforts financially.

<h2>Problem 4: Limited Awareness and Engagement</h2>

Solution: Providing valid and verified sites educating more about sustainable ways to conserve and preserve the nature and wildlife.

# Soroban Project

## Project Structure

This repository uses the recommended structure for a Soroban project:
```text
.
├── contracts
│   └── hello_world
│       ├── src
│       │   ├── lib.rs
│       │   └── test.rs
│       └── Cargo.toml
├── Cargo.toml
└── README.md
```

- New Soroban contracts can be put in `contracts`, each in their own directory. There is already a `hello_world` contract in there to get you started.
- If you initialized this project with any other example contracts via `--with-example`, those contracts will be in the `contracts` directory as well.
- Contracts should have their own `Cargo.toml` files that rely on the top-level `Cargo.toml` workspace for their dependencies.
